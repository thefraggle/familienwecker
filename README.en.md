**Everyone sleeps longer. Nobody fights over the bathroom. Start your day relaxed.**

The **FamWake Family Alarm** is the intelligent solution for a relaxed morning routine. Instead of rigid wake-up times, the app dynamically adapts to the schedules and needs of all family members.

## ✨ The Highlights

* **Maximum Sleep Time:** A clever algorithm calculates the absolutely perfect daily wake-up plan for the entire family.
* **No Bathroom Traffic Jams:** Wake-up times are intelligently coordinated so that the bathroom is always handed over seamlessly.
* **Shared Time:** The app finds the ideal slot for everyone who wants to have breakfast together.
* **Weekend Switch:** Simply pause your own alarm – meaning your bathroom slots expire so the rest of the family can sleep in even longer.
